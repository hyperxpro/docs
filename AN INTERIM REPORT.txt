1. INTRODUCTION
This project, titled “Impact analysis of training given by IOCL to retail sales team” & “Training on Wheels,” forms the cornerstone of my three-month internship experience within the Learning and Development (L&D) Department at Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). The L&D function at IOCL is a crucial pillar supporting the organization’s strategic objectives, and during my internship, I was fortunate to witness and participate in the processes that drive employee growth and organizational capability.
The primary aim of this interim report is to provide a critical examination of the effectiveness of training programs administered by IOCL to its retail sales team, with a particular focus on the 2023-2024 batch. The report scrutinizes not only the immediate outcomes of these training initiatives but also their long-term implications as the “face” of Indian Oil in the eyes of customers and the public. Furthermore, this analysis seeks to measure the return on investment (ROI) in terms of improvements in employee performance, engagement, and overall retention within the organization.
IOCL’s reputation as a leading entity in the Indian energy sector is closely tied to the skill, competence, and motivation of its workforce. The organization recognizes that to retain its competitive edge and fulfill its mission of serving the nation’s energy needs, it must constantly invest in the development of its human capital. In this context, structured and well-implemented training programs—such as the Shakti initiative—serve as vital engines for employee empowerment, particularly for women, and for ensuring sustained organizational success.
The report provides a detailed analysis of the Shakti program’s outcomes, identifying both the high points and the challenges encountered during implementation. Emphasis is placed on the alignment of training objectives with broader organizational goals, especially in the context of women empowerment and leadership development. By dissecting the successes and areas for improvement, the report aims to offer valuable lessons for future iterations of the program.
Throughout my internship, I engaged in a range of activities to observe and evaluate the impact of training on the retail sales team. This included the administration of surveys, the collection and analysis of participant feedback, and direct interaction with the HR team. These efforts enabled me to gain nuanced insights into the effectiveness of training programs like SHAKTI, the practical challenges of implementation, and the opportunities for enhancing employee development, engagement, and retention.
The objectives of this report are as follows:
•	To evaluate the effectiveness of the SHAKTI program for employee development, with a particular focus on its ability to build skills, confidence, and motivation among participants.
•	To assess the ROI of the program in terms of measurable improvements in employee performance, customer service, and organizational retention rates.
•	To identify specific areas where the training process can be improved, especially with regard to its alignment with IOCL’s strategic goals and its role in promoting women empowerment.
•	To provide actionable recommendations that contribute to IOCL’s long-term organizational objectives and operational efficiency, ensuring that training remains a cornerstone of the company’s growth strategy.
2. OIL & GAS INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
The oil and gas sector in India is both vast and critical, serving as the backbone of the nation’s industrial, economic, and social growth. To understand the significance of IOCL’s work and the Shakti and Training on Wheels programs, it is vital to contextualize them within the broader landscape of the Indian oil and gas industry.
2.1 Introduction to the Sector
The Indian oil and gas industry is one of the most essential sectors for the country’s development. It is responsible for ensuring the continuous supply of energy to industries, transportation, agriculture, and households. The sector’s importance can be seen in its extensive infrastructure, which includes thousands of kilometers of pipelines, numerous refineries, and an ever-expanding network of retail outlets. The reliability and efficiency of these operations are crucial for the stability and growth of the Indian economy, and therefore, any improvement in workforce competency directly impacts national interests.
Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) is a major player in this context. As a government-owned enterprise, IOCL holds a prominent position not only because of its scale and reach but also due to its strategic significance. The company is known for its efforts in refining, pipeline transportation, and the marketing of petroleum products. It also plays a major role in ensuring that India meets its energy requirements in a reliable, safe, and sustainable manner.
2.2 Sector Classification and Government Policy
The oil and gas sector is classified as a strategic industry in India. It draws both public and private investment and is subject to rigorous regulation and policy oversight. Over the years, policies such as allowing 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in certain segments, including natural gas, petroleum products, and refineries, have been implemented to encourage innovation, technology transfer, and capital inflow. For public sector refining projects, the FDI cap has been raised to 49% without requiring dilution of government equity. This policy landscape has stimulated significant domestic and international investments, leading to growth and modernization within the sector.
Major players in the market include public sector undertakings (PSUs) like IOCL, BPCL, and HPCL, as well as private companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Cairn India. The sector’s competitive environment necessitates continuous improvements in operational excellence and workforce capabilities.
2.3 Sector Outlook
The future outlook for the Indian oil and gas sector is optimistic. India, already a refining hub with 23 refineries, continues to expand its infrastructure to meet rising domestic and international demand. The government’s focus on energy security and self-reliance, combined with ambitious plans for investment—such as the projected US$25 billion in exploration and production by 2022—underscores the sector’s growth trajectory.
The sector is also adapting to global trends, including the push toward renewable energy and sustainable fuels. Companies like IOCL are investing in alternative sources such as hydrogen, biofuels, and compressed biogas (CBG), in line with India’s clean energy goals. This transition requires reskilling the existing workforce and introducing new competencies, making the role of training and development even more significant.
2.4 IOCL’s Leadership and Growth
IOCL’s leadership in the sector is marked by several achievements and milestones. As a ‘Maharatna’ company under government control, IOCL has government-nominated directors on its board and contributed INR 2,416 billion to the exchequer in FY24, showcasing its economic importance. With 11 refineries and a capacity of 80.80 MMTPA, IOCL accounts for 31% of India’s domestic refining capacity, making it the largest refiner in the country.
Its pipeline network, spanning approximately 18,400 kilometers and handling 124.4 MMTPA, represents a 62% share of the downstream pipeline sector by length. IOCL’s extensive network ensures that even remote and challenging terrains are served, with more than 60,900 customer touchpoints across India. The company’s highest-ever profit of ₹39,619 crore in FY24 and its 42% market share in POL further highlight its leading position.
IOCL has also emerged as a leader in petrochemicals and exploration and production (E&P), holding a strong patent portfolio and investing in alternative energy sources. Its consistent compound annual growth rate and expansion into new business areas exemplify its commitment to innovation and sustainable growth. All these achievements are underpinned by a strong emphasis on workforce development, a theme which is central to this report.

5. INTERNSHIP STUDY: EXPERIENCES AND CONTRIBUTIONS
5.1 Introduction
My internship at IOCL stands as one of the most formative experiences in my professional and academic journey. The company’s vast scope, its structured approach to talent management, and its culture of continuous learning provided the ideal environment for me to immerse myself in real-world HR and Learning & Development (L&D) challenges. The following sections chronicle my internship experience in a detailed and reflective manner, offering a comprehensive overview of both the tasks undertaken and the lessons learned.
From the outset, my internship goals were clear and aligned with both the organization’s objectives and my personal aspirations. I was to contribute to the analysis and optimization of the Shakti training initiative and the Training on Wheels program, both of which are crucial for IOCL’s mission of workforce development and national service. My responsibilities spanned across data management, survey administration, feedback analysis, event planning, communication design, and confidential HR tasks—each offering unique insights into the operations of a large PSU.
5.2 Project Objectives: Deep Dive
The objectives of my internship were crafted to ensure a holistic exposure to the multifaceted world of corporate training. Each objective was not just a checkbox, but an ongoing process that demanded active participation, critical thinking, and adaptability.
1. Assessing Effectiveness and Reach of Training Programs
A primary focus was to evaluate how effective the training programs were, especially in terms of the actual impact on Customer Attendants (CAs) and Retail Outlet (RO) Managers. This involved not only reviewing quantitative data but also observing behavioral changes, improvements in customer service, and the extent to which employees felt empowered after training. The goal was to move beyond surface-level metrics and understand the deeper transformation that training could bring about.
2. Evaluating Participant Feedback and Ground-Level Performance
Feedback from participants is often the most honest reflection of a program’s success. My role involved designing surveys that encouraged candid responses, conducting follow-up interviews, and analyzing the data collected. It was important to connect the dots between what was taught in the training sessions and what was actually practiced on the retail floor. This meant looking for tangible evidence of learning—such as improved interaction with customers, better hygiene practices, and more effective use of digital tools.
3. Researching the Adoption and Reach of “Training on Wheels”
The “Training on Wheels” program is a unique initiative intended to address the challenges of geographical diversity and accessibility. My task was to track how widely the program was adopted, what barriers existed to its implementation, and how it could be made more effective. This involved not just reviewing records but also engaging with participants in rural and remote locations to understand their experiences and needs.
4. Designing, Documenting, and Reporting on Events and Training Sessions
Event planning was an integral part of my internship. It required attention to detail, time management, and an understanding of participant needs. From the Women’s Day Ceremony to the Library-based Treasure Hunt, each event was an opportunity to contribute to IOCL’s culture of inclusivity and engagement. I was responsible for everything from logistics planning and volunteer management to preparing reports and presentations.
5. Understanding Learning & Development in a PSU
Perhaps the most valuable objective was to gain a holistic understanding of how L&D operates within a public sector environment. This meant appreciating the complexity of compliance requirements, the importance of standardized processes, and the dynamic interplay between organizational goals and individual aspirations.

5.3 Detailed Description of Work Done
5.3.1 Onboarding and Familiarization
The first phase of my internship was dedicated to understanding the structure, vision, and operational mechanisms of IOCL. This began with a thorough review of the latest Annual Report and internal documentation. By analyzing these documents, I was able to piece together a comprehensive view of IOCL’s strategic direction, the importance of its L&D function, and the role of training in supporting its mission.
I made it a point to interact with members from various departments, including retail operations and customer care, to understand their perspectives and expectations from L&D. These conversations helped me appreciate the interconnectedness of different functions and the importance of alignment in achieving organizational success.
5.3.2 Data Management and Digitalization
One of my early responsibilities involved digitizing attendance and feedback records from over 60 training sessions conducted across districts such as Bharuch, Kamrej, Surat, and Gandhidham. This was a meticulous process that required converting handwritten and photographic records into structured Excel and Word tables.
The process of digitization was both challenging and rewarding. It was challenging because it required a high degree of accuracy and attention to detail—any error could compromise the integrity of the data. At the same time, it was rewarding to see how digital records could streamline reporting, enable real-time analysis, and support data-driven decision-making. The experience reinforced the importance of robust data management systems in modern HR practice.
5.3.3 Post-training Feedback and Impact Analysis
Administering post-training surveys was a core part of my role. I designed survey forms that balanced quantitative metrics (such as satisfaction scores) with qualitative feedback (such as open-ended questions about key learnings). Conducting follow-up calls with participants allowed me to probe deeper into their experiences, capturing nuances that might not have been evident in written responses.
The analysis of feedback focused on several dimensions:
•	Content Effectiveness: Did the training content meet the needs of employees?
•	Trainer Quality: Were the trainers able to engage participants and clarify doubts?
•	Behavioral Change: Were there observable improvements in areas like customer handling, personal hygiene, and use of digital tools?
By triangulating survey data with on-the-ground observations, I was able to provide a well-rounded assessment of training impact.
5.3.4 Event Planning and Community Involvement
Beyond training analysis, I had the opportunity to contribute to several engagement initiatives. For instance, the Women’s Day Ceremony was a large-scale event that required careful coordination of schedules, resources, and volunteers. My responsibilities included preparing the event timetable, assigning tasks to volunteers, and ensuring that all logistical arrangements were in place.
The Library-based Treasure Hunt was another innovative event aimed at promoting reading habits among employees. I was involved in developing clues, guiding participants, and facilitating the smooth running of the event. These experiences deepened my understanding of event management and highlighted the importance of creative engagement strategies in building organizational culture.
5.3.5 Communication and Content Creation
Effective communication is the backbone of any successful training or engagement initiative. I contributed to the design of posters and presentation materials using tools like Canva, ensuring that all communications were visually appealing and consistent with IOCL’s brand identity.
A unique aspect of my work was developing thumbnails for 81 Sampark community videos. This required not only technical design skills but also an understanding of the company’s messaging and target audience. Preparing PowerPoint presentations and brochures for events and training sessions further honed my ability to distill complex information into clear, compelling formats.
5.3.6 Management of Confidential Projects
Handling confidential data is a responsibility that demands both technical competence and ethical integrity. I was entrusted with developing promotion lists for various zones—including Northeast India—based on confidential training performance figures and internal reports.
This task required strict adherence to data protection protocols and a professional approach to sensitive information. It reinforced the importance of trust in HR functions and the need for robust systems to safeguard employee data.

5.4 Project: Training on Wheels—An In-Depth Analysis
The Training on Wheels initiative is a testament to IOCL’s commitment to inclusivity and accessibility in workforce development. The program was conceived to overcome the logistical challenges posed by India’s vast geography, ensuring that employees in remote and rural areas receive the same quality of training as those in urban centers.
My analysis of the program revealed several key insights:
•	Increased Participation: By bringing training directly to rural retail outlets, the program significantly boosted attendance among Customer Attendants who might otherwise have missed out on these opportunities due to travel constraints.
•	Practical Demonstrations: The use of field demonstrations enhanced understanding and retention of safety and operating procedures, making training more relevant and impactful.
•	Logistical Challenges: Despite its success, the program faced challenges related to the availability of equipment and trainers. My feedback reports documented these issues and suggested ways to streamline operations for future sessions.
The Training on Wheels initiative not only democratizes access to learning but also serves as a model for other organizations seeking to bridge the urban-rural divide in workforce development.

7.2 Shakti Training Program: Effectiveness and Impact
7.2.1 Participant Response and Engagement
The Shakti training program, as observed during my internship, was met with notable enthusiasm and participation by the retail outlet team. The program’s structure, which emphasized interactive sessions and practical demonstrations, proved to be not only engaging but also highly effective in transmitting core concepts. Trainees regularly expressed appreciation for the hands-on components, citing these as directly relevant to their daily work experiences.
Throughout multiple feedback sessions, a recurring theme was the improvement in self-confidence among participants. Many women, in particular, reported feeling more empowered and valued after the training. This sense of empowerment was not just a fleeting sentiment—several follow-up interactions indicated that participants were more proactive in their roles, volunteering for new responsibilities and showing greater initiative in customer engagement.
7.2.2 Knowledge and Skills Enhancement
A significant improvement was observed in areas such as product knowledge, use of electronic billing systems, communication etiquette, and hygiene maintenance. Survey responses highlighted an increased understanding of the technical aspects of retail operations, as well as an enhanced ability to handle customer queries and complaints with composure and professionalism.
The training also fostered a culture of continuous learning. Many employees started seeking additional resources, asking for refresher sessions, and even forming informal peer-learning groups at their outlets. This organic spread of learning beyond the formal training session is a testament to the program’s effectiveness in instilling a growth mindset.
7.2.3 Quality of Trainers
Feedback consistently indicated high levels of satisfaction with the trainers. Their approachability, clear communication, and willingness to address doubts were frequently cited as strengths. Trainers who incorporated real-life scenarios and encouraged interactive problem-solving were particularly praised.
However, some participants suggested that while trainers excelled in delivering the core curriculum, they could further enhance sessions by contextualizing examples to specific local challenges. This would make the training even more relevant and actionable for diverse retail environments.
7.2.4 Post-training Behavioural Change
One of the most compelling outcomes was the observable behavioural changes in the workplace. Employees who had undergone Shakti training demonstrated increased attentiveness to customer needs, meticulous adherence to hygiene protocols, and a readiness to adopt new digital tools.

Because the training was delivered on-site, employees were able to immediately apply new knowledge and skills in their work environment. This immediate reinforcement led to better retention of concepts and more rapid integration of best practices into daily routines.
Field demonstrations, in particular, were highlighted as a strength of the program. Employees were able to practice safety drills, digital billing, and customer service scenarios in a real-world context, which made the learning tangible and memorable.
7.3.3 Logistical Challenges and Recommendations
Despite its success, the Training on Wheels program encountered certain logistical hurdles. These included the limited availability of training equipment, occasional scheduling conflicts, and the challenge of coordinating trainers across vast geographic areas.
Based on participant feedback and my own observations, I recommend:
•	Increasing the pool of trainers with specialized local knowledge.
•	Ensuring that training equipment is portable, well-maintained, and readily available.
•	Developing a rotating schedule to cover more locations consistently.
