 INTRODUCTION
This project titled "Impact analysis of training given by IOCL to retail sales team"
& “Training on Wheels” is part of my 3-month internship in the Learning and Development
Department at Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). During my time as an intern, I had the
opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the processes related to training and
development within the organization. The purpose of this interim report is to examine the
effectiveness of the training given by IOCL to retail sales team for the 2023-2024 batch, with
a focus on its impact as face of Indian Oil and the return on investment (ROI) in terms of
employee performance, engagement, and retention.
IOCL, as a leading organization in the energy sector, relies heavily on its workforce’s
competency and leadership skills to maintain its competitive edge. In this context, effective
training programs, such as Shakti, play a critical role in shaping women empowerment and
ensuring the long-term success of the company. By analysing the outcomes of the Shakti
program, this report seeks to identify both the successes and challenges faced in the training
process, particularly in terms of its ROI and leadership development impact.
During the internship, I was able to observe the challenges faced by IOCL in aligning training
objectives with organizational goals, while also assessing the improvement in development
capabilities post-training. Through data collection via survey, participant feedback, and
discussions with the HR team, I have gathered key insights on how training programs like
SHAKTI contribute to Employee development, while also identifying areas for enhancement.
The findings presented in this report aim to help IOCL optimize its training strategies to better
support employee development, employee engagement, and talent retention.
The objectives of this report are as follows:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the SHAKTI program for employee’s development.
To assess the ROI of the program in terms of employee performance.
8
To identify areas for improvement in the training process to enhance its alignment with
organizational goals and women empowerment.
To ensure that the recommendations contribute to IOCL’s long-term organizational objectives
and operational efficiency.
Limitations of the Study
Limited Access to Confidential Data
Because of data privacy and internal policy limitations, complete access to employee tax
records and payroll files were restricted, which limited the extent of analysis for some cases
(particularly foreign salary elements and reimbursements).
Time Constraints
The internship period was short, only a few months, limiting the scope for long-term
monitoring, recommendation implementation, or extensive trend analysis over several
financial years.
Limited System Permissions
SAP and payroll modules were available for read-only or limited write access, hindering
hands-on entries for certain financial transactions and necessitating reliance on the finance
team for inputs and checks.
Variations at Regional Level Policies
State-wise differences in Professional Tax regulations and LTA policies presented issues in
compliance checks and inter-regional comparison standardization.
